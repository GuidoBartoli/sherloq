<h1 class='up'>Writing Meta Information</h1>
<a name='Abstract'></a>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>Writing meta information is more complicated than it may appear at first
glance, which may be one reason why there are very few utilities around that do
it. ExifTool uses tag names to identify the different pieces of meta information
that can be extracted from a file.  There are thousands of different tags that
ExifTool recognizes, and many of these tag names are common between different
metadata formats (the WhiteBalance tag is the worst offender, and can be found
in 65 different places [ExifTool 10.64]), and sometimes the information can even
be stored in different places within a single format.  Couple this with the fact
that many manufacturers store meta information in undocumented formats which
must be reverse engineered (and each of which have their particular quirks), and
you have a very complex situation.</p>

<p>ExifTool attempts to simplify this situation as much as possible by making
reasonable decisions about where to write the information you specify, yet it
maintains flexibility by allowing you to configure its priorities if necessary,
or even override the decision making process entirely.</p>

<a name='Background'></a>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>For a long time, I resisted adding write abilities to ExifTool even though it
was an oft-requested feature.  My concerns in adding this feature were:</p>
<ol>
<li>It would complicate the ExifTool interface and make it too confusing for
typical users.</li>
<li>It would complicate the code enough to slow down processing for normal use.</li>
<li>It would take a LOT of work to implement.</li>
</ol>
<p>After thinking about this for a while, I was finally able to come up with some
solutions:</p>

<p>1. I designed an interface that I think is easy to use for people who
don't want to know the details of the file structure, yet powerful enough for
people who want to do very specific things to the information.</p>

<p>2. I isolated all of the writing code as much as possible into separate files
which autoload as required.  This keeps the compilation fast for people who
don't require the write feature.  Also, I have left the reading routines
unchanged, so they aren't slowed down by the extra code needed when writing
information.  Unfortunately, this meant I couldn't borrow a lot of code from the
read routines (even more work for me!), but it had the advantage that I could
perform additional optimizations in the write routines that I couldn't do
otherwise.  Although the startup costs of this implementation are fairly high
(for writing only), it should be quite fast for batch writing of multiple files.</p>

<p>3. I decided to bite the bullet and invest the time required (...guess what I
did for my Christmas vacation!).  Although I thought that a big project like
this would be better suited to C++ (faster execution and a broader potential
user base), after programming this so far in Perl I have grown to really
appreciate the automatic memory handling and other great features of Perl such
as hash lookups and incredible flexibility in text manipulations afforded by
regular expressions.</p>

<a name='Implementation'></a>
<h3>Current Implementation</h3>
<p>Currently, ExifTool can write most of the EXIF tags that anyone could reasonably
want to change (but some tags are protected because they describe physical
characteristics of the image that you can not change with ExifTool, eg.
Compression).  Also, all of the GPS, IPTC and XMP information and most of the
MakerNotes information can be edited.  This gives you great power, but with
great power, comes great responsibility...</p>

<p>It is possible for you to write nonsense into a file, which could cause other
image readers to throw up their hands in despair and refuse to read the image.
For this reason, it is best to always preserve the original copy of your image
file.  The "exiftool" script does this for you automatically by renaming the
original file and always working on a copy.</p>

<p>The writing logic for ExifTool is the reverse of the reading logic.  You
provide human-readable values and ExifTool will perform the conversions for you.
For instance, you can set "WhiteBalance" to "Daylight" and ExifTool will change
the value of WhiteBalance in the image wherever the tag is found provided that
"Daylight" is a valid value for that location.  ExifTool will even do some simple
matching so that you could even just set it to "day", and ExifTool will search
through the valid values and will choose the one that contains the string "day".
If the value is ambiguous, the tag will not be set.  If no tags can be set with
the specified value, ExifTool returns an error message.</p>

<p>The tag values can also be specified at a numerical level by disabling the
print conversions that are normally applied.  This can be done on a tag-by-tag
basis or on a global basis through either the application or the API.</p>

<p>As well as changing tag values wherever they are found in the image, exiftool
will also create the tag in the preferred group if it didn't exist there before.
By default, the preferred group is the first of the following where the tag is
found: 1) EXIF, 2) IPTC, 3) XMP.  Alternatively, the desired group (in family 0
or 1) can be specified so ExifTool only writes the tag to a single location. For
example, with the command line interface, this is done using an argument like
"<code>-EXIF:WhiteBalance=Manual</code>".</p>

<p>If a tag is added to a group that doesn't exist, the new group is created in
the file, and required mandatory tags may be created.  Conversely, if the last
non-mandatory tag is deleted from a group, the group is removed from the file.</p>

<a name='Mandatory'></a>
<h3>Mandatory Tags</h3>

<p>The EXIF and IPTC standards both specify some mandatory tags.  ExifTool will
automatically create many of these mandatory tags as required when writing new
information (and remove them again when deleting information if only mandatory
tags remain).  However, some mandatory tags (particularly in the IPTC
information) can not be easily added automatically, so it is left up to the user
to add these tags if required.  Note that ExifTool 12.71 adds an API
<a href="ExifTool.html#NoMandatory">NoMandatory</a> option which bypasses
the creation/deletion of mandatory tags in EXIF when writing.</p>

<blockquote class='aside'>
<b>Rant:</b> Let me say that the whole concept of mandatory tags is flawed.
Instead of mandatory tags, the standard should specify default values to be
assumed if the tags don't exist.  A robust reader has to do this anyway, so it
is redundant to require that this information must be written.  In the case
where there is no simple default value, the reader must be able to deal with the
missing tag, otherwise it places the burden on the writer to magically pull a
reasonable value out of thin air.  Of course, you may say that the writer could
get this information from the user, but conditions like this add an unnecessary
level complexity to the user interface.

<h3>The JPEG Segment Size Limitation</h3>

<p>An unfortunate aspect of the JPEG format is that the size of a single segment
is limited to less than 64 kB.  With the 2-byte size word at the start of each
segment, this leaves 65533 bytes for data.  The EXIF specification states that
the data must fit within a single <b>APP1</b> segment (which results in the
preview image problem discussed below), however <b>APP13</b> Photoshop and
<b>APP2</b> ICC Profile and FPXR information may span multiple segments.  This
multi-segment information is handled properly by ExifTool.</p>

<p>JPEG comments may also exceed the size of a single <b>COM</b> segment. If
necessary, comments are automatically split into separate segments when writing.
However, when reading they are not joined together because some utilities store
distinctly different comments in separate segments.  To extract all JPEG
comments into a single file, and combine any comments that may have been split
into multiple segments, use "<code>exiftool -a -b -comment src.jpg &gt;
comment.out</code>".</p>

<a name='Preview'></a>
<h3>The Preview Image Problem</h3>

<p>Writing the preview image in JPEG files poses many problems of its own.  These
problems stem from the fact that the JPEG standard is inadequate for storing
large preview images due to the 64kB limit on segment size as mentioned above.
(Note that TIFF images don't have this problem since they have a 4GB limit.)
Some manufacturers get around this by appending the preview after the normal end
of the JPEG file (JPEG EOI), but this causes complications because it means that
the preview image pointers in the EXIF information now point outside the EXIF
segment.  This is truly unfortunate because it greatly complicates things for
image writing software.  Most other software can't deal with a preview image and
will simply remove a preview like this when rewriting the file.</p>

<p>However, as of ExifTool version 5, the preview images are handled properly
when writing EXIF information in JPEG files.  But for reasons of efficiency, the
EXIF segment is not edited when writing information if no EXIF tags are being
changed (eg. if only XMP or IPTC information is being edited).  In this case,
the preview image pointers could be invalidated because the length of the data
between the EXIF segment (which comes near the start of the file) and the
preview image (at the end of the file) is likely to change.  ExifTool gets
around this when reading JPEG images by looking for the preview at the end of
the file and updating pointers if necessary, but the preview image may not be
readable by other software (it should be noted though that very few image
readers even know the preview image exists).  However, the preview pointers in
such a file can be fixed if necessary by simply using ExifTool to edit any EXIF
information.</p>

<p><b>2009-05-26</b>: New Samsung cameras recently started embedding preview
images larger than 64 kB, and of course they created a new technique to do so.
If they were smart, they would have developed a simple technique that could be
used by others in the future, but of course they were stupid, and didn't think
that far ahead. (Such is the normal path of dumb camera manufacturers when it
comes to metadata.)</p>

<p>The new Samsung models simply split the preview and write it to separate APP2
segments with no header. If they had written a header (like "PREVIEW\0" for
example), then the technique could be portable and useful. But they didn't.
Without a header, the data can not easily be distinguished from other random APP2
data, so this technique is not generally useful.  Of course, there are
disadvantages with splitting up a preview into separate JPEG segments, so this
technique in general is not ideal.</p>

<p><b>2009-06-12</b>:
<a href="http://www.cipa.jp/std/std-sec_e.html">CIPA</a>
has recently released a "<b>Multi-Picture Format</b>" standard for storing large
images in JPEG files.  Again, there is a big problem with this standard:  It
uses offsets that are relative to the start of the MPF header (in the new MPF
APP2 segment) to reference images after the JPEG EOI.  These offsets will
quickly be broken if any data after the MPF segment changes length.  This
problem could have been avoided if offsets had been specified relative to the
end of file, but it is too late for this now that the specification is
public.</p>

<p>The only workable alternative I can see is to enforce the rule that the MPF
APP2 segment must come after all other APP segments.  (It would have been smart
if this was specified in the CIPA standard, but sadly this isn't the case.)  If
this is done, then metadata in the remaining APP segments (EXIF, IPTC, XMP, etc)
can safely be edited without breaking the MPF offsets.  I suggest that all
metadata editors employ this strategy, regardless of the segment order specified
in the standard (which says that the MPF APP2 segment must come immediately
after the EXIF APP1 segment).</p>

<a name='IFD0'></a>
<h3>IFD0/ExifIFD Ambiguity</h3>

<p>ExifTool has a preferred location (IFD) where it writes all EXIF tags. 
However, a number of tags are written to different locations by various digital
cameras or image editors.  Specifically, the following tags have been observed
in both IFD0 and ExifIFD: Make, Model, Software, Artist, DateTimeOriginal,
SensingMethod, CustomRendered, ExposureMode, WhiteBalance, DigitalZoomRatio and
SceneCaptureType.  To handle this ambiguity, ExifTool will delete the tag if it
exists in IFD0 when it is written to ExifIFD, and vice versa.</p>
