  <br><b>An open source image forensic toolset</b>
</p>

# Introduction
"*Forensic Image Analysis is the application of image science and domain expertise to interpret the content of an image and/or the image itself in legal matters. Major subdisciplines of Forensic Image Analysis with law enforcement applications include: Photogrammetry, Photographic Comparison, Content Analysis, and Image Authentication.*" (Scientific Working Group on Imaging Technologies)

**Sherloq** is a personal research project about implementing a fully integrated environment for digital image forensics. It is not meant as an automatic tool that decide if an image is forged or not (that tool probably will never exist...), but as a companion in experimenting with various algorithms found in the latest research papers and workshops.

While many commercial solutions have high retail prices and often reserved to law enforcement and government agencies only, this toolset aims to be a both an extensible framework and a starting point for anyone interested in making experiments in this particular application of digital signal processing.

I strongly believe that *security-by-obscurity* is the wrong way to offer any kind of forensic service (i.e. "Using this proprietary software I guarantee you that this photo *is* pristine... and you have to trust me!"). Following the open-source philosophy, everyone should be able to try various techniques on their own, gain knowledge and share it to the community... even better if they contribute with code improvements! :)

# History
The first version was written in 2015 using C++11 to build a command line utility with many options, but soon it turned to be too cumbersome and not much interactive. That version could be compiled with CMake after installing OpenCV, Boost and AlgLib libraries. This first proof of concept offered about 80% of planned features (see below for the full list).

While also including novel algorithms, the 2017 version mainly added a Qt-based multi-window GUI to provide a better user experience. Multiple analyses could be shown on screen and a fast zoom/scroll  viewer was implemented for easier image navigation. That project could be compiled with Qt Creator with Qt 5 and OpenCV 3 and covered about 70% of planned features.

Fast-forward to 2020 when I decided to port everything in Python (PySide2 + Matplotlib + OpenCV) for easier development and deployment. While this iteration is just begun and I have yet to port all the previous code on the new platform, I think this will be the final "form" of the project (as long as someone does not volunteer up to develop a nice web application!).

I'm happy to share my code and get in contact with anyone interested to improve or test it, but please keep in mind that this repository is *not* intended for distributing a final product, my aim is just to publicly track development of an *unpretentious educational tool*, so expect bugs, unpolished code and missing features! ;)

# Features
This list contains the functions that the toolkit will (hopefully) provide once beta stage is reached (**NOTE:** functions displayed in _italics_ inside the program are not yet implemented!).

### Various
- __Median Filtering__: detect processing traces left by nonlinear median filtering
- __Illuminant Map__: estimate scene local light direction on estimated 3D surfaces
- __Dead/Hot Pixels__: detect and fix dead/hot pixels caused by sensor imperfections
- __Stereogram Decoder__: decode 3D images concealed in crossed-eye autostereograms

# Installation

## [1/4]

Clone the current repository into a local folder and change current directory to it.

## [2/4] Virtual environment

For more information about Python Virtual Environments, you can read [here](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/) or [here](https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2018/09/04/python-virtual-environments/).

### [Built-in Virtual Environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)
Change current directory to Sherloq root, then initialize virtual environment folder:
```console
$ python -m venv .venv
```
Then activate it:
#### Linux
```console
$ source .venv/bin/activate
```

#### Windows
```console
C:\> .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

### VirtualEnvWrapper

#### Linux
```console
$ sudo apt install python3-distutils python3-dev python3-testresources subversion
$ wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
$ sudo python3 get-pip.py
$ rm get-pip.py
$ sudo pip install virtualenv virtualenvwrapper
$ echo -e "\n# Python Virtual Environments" >> ~/.bashrc
$ echo "export WORKON_HOME=$HOME/.virtualenvs" >> ~/.bashrc
$ echo "export VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PYTHON=/usr/bin/python3" >> ~/.bashrc
$ echo "source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh" >> ~/.bashrc
$ source ~/.bashrc
$ mkvirtualenv sq -p python3
```

#### MacOS [untested]

1) Open Terminal and enter `python3 --version` to install the interpreter and other command line tools
2) Once installed, proceed similarly to Linux installation:
```console
$ wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
$ sudo python3 get-pip.py
$ sudo pip install virtualenv virtualenvwrapper
$ echo -e "\n# Python Virtual Environments" >> ~/.bash_profile
$ echo "export WORKON_HOME=$HOME/.virtualenvs" >> ~/.bash_profile
$ echo "export VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PYTHON=/usr/bin/python3" >> ~/.bash_profile
$ echo "source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh" >> ~/.bash_profile
$ source ~/.bash_profile
```
3) Create a new Python 3 virtual environment:
```console
$ mkvirtualenv sq -p python3
```
4) Install `libmagic` via `brew` (thanks to @thmsl):
```console
$ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
$ brew install libmagic
```

#### Windows
1. Download *Python 3.10* setup package from [official site](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Install ensuring that "Add Python to PATH" and "PIP installation" are enabled
3. Open *Command Prompt* and enter the following commands:
```console
> pip install virtualenv virtualenvwrapper-win
> mkvirtualenv sq
```

## [3/4] Install dependencies
